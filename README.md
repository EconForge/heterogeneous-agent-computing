# heterogeneous-agent-computing
A repository for the Heterogeneous-Agents Computing (HAC) project. This project aims to create a simple modular framework which can execute and estimate any heterogeneous-agent model in the economics literature. The goal is lofty but we believe a multi-pronged effort (which emphasizes innovative incentives for open collaboration) will make it a reality.
